.TH ser2net 1 06/02/01  "Serial to network proxy"

.SH NAME
ser2net \- Serial to network proxy

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ser2net
[\-c configfile] [\-p controlport] [\-n]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ser2net
daemon allows telnet and tcp sessions to be established with a unit's
serial ports.
.PP
The program comes up normally as a daemon, opens the TCP ports
specified in the configuration file, and waits for connections.  Once
a connection occurs, the program attempts to set up the connection and
open the serial port.  If another user is already using the connection
or serial port, the connection is refused with an error message.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-c config\-file"
Set the configuration file to one other than the default of
.BR "/etc/ser2net.conf"
.TP
.I \-n
Stops  the  daemon  from  forking  and  detaching  from the controlling
terminal. This is most useful for debugging purposes.
.TP
.I \-p port
Enables the control port and sets the IP port to listen to for the
control port.

.SH CONTROL PORT
The control port provides a simple interface for controlling the ports and 
viewing their status. To accomplish this, it has the following commands:
.TP
.B showport [<TCP port>]
Show information about a port. If no port is given, all ports are displayed.
.TP
.B help
Display a short list and summary of commands.
.TP
.B exit
Disconnect from the control port.
.TP
.B setporttimeout <tcp port> <timeout>
Set the amount of time in seconds before the port connection will be
shut down if no activity has been seen on the port.
.TP
.B setportconfig <tcp port> <config>
Set the port configuration as in the device configuration in the
.BR /etc/ser2net.conf
file.  If conflicting options are specified, the last option will
be the one used.  Note that these will not change until the port
is disconnected and connected again.  Options
.I 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200
set the various baud rates.
.I EVEN, ODD, NONE
set the parity.
.I 1STOPBIT, 2STOPBITS
set the number of stop bits.
.I 7DATABITS, 8DATABITS
set the number of data bits.
.TP
.B setportenable <tcp port> <enable state>
Sets the port operation state.  Valid states are:
.I off
to shut the TCP port down,
.I raw
to enable the TCP port transfer all I/O as-is, and
.I telnet
to enable the TCP port is up run the telnet negotiation protocol on the port.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration is accomplished through the file
.BR /etc/ser2net.conf .
A file with another name or path may be specified using the
.I \-c
option.  This  file consists of one or more entries with the following
format:
.IP
<IP port>:<state>:<timeout>:<device>:<options>
.PP
.SS FIELDS
.TP
.I "IP port"
Name  or number of the TCP/IP port to accept connections from for this
device.
.TP
.I state
Either 
.BR raw
or
.BR telnet
or
.BR off.
.I off
disables the port from accepting connections.  It can be turned
on later from the control port.
.I raw
enables the port and transfers all data as-is between the port and
the long.
.I telnet
enables the port and runs the telnet protocol on the port to set up
telnet parameters.  This is most useful for using telnet.
.TP
.I device
The  name  of  the  device  to connect to. This must be in the form of
.BR /dev/<device> .
.TP
.I "device configuration options"
Sets operational parameters for the serial port.  Options
.I 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200
set the various baud rates.
.I EVEN, ODD, NONE
set the parity.
.I 1STOPBIT, 2STOPBITS
set the number of stop bits.
.I 7DATABITS, 8DATABITS
set the number of data bits.

.PP
Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored.

.SH FILES
/etc/ser2net.conf

.SH "SEE ALSO"
telnet(1)

.SH "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
The program does not do UUCP file locking and it won't play nice with
getty.
