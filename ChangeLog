	* ser2net.c, controller.c - added a way to query the version from
	the command line and from the controller port.

	* controller.c, controller.h, dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h - added
	monitoring of data flowing into a port.  It's somewhat primitive
	yet, but still useful

	* controller.c, dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h - added a way to disconnect
	a port from the control port.
